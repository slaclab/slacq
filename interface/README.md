# Quench Labeling Interface

A Streamlit web app for viewing and labeling cavity quench waveforms stored in HDF5 files.

---

## What You Need Before Starting

- **Python 3.12 or newer** installed on your computer
- **Git** installed (to clone the repository)
- An **HDF5 (`.h5`) data file** containing quench events *(not included in this repo)*

To check if you have Python and Git:

```bash
python --version
git --version
```

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
If you haven't already cloned the repo, clone it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/slaclab/slacq.git
cd slacq
```

## Step 2: Create a Conda Environment 
If you haven't already created a conda environment, use this command to create one:
```bash
conda create -n YOUR_ENV_NAME python=3.12
```

## Step 3: Activate the Conda Environment


```bash
conda activate YOUR_ENV_NAME
```

## Step 4: Install Dependencies
If you haven't installed all the dependencies, use this command to install them:
```bash
conda install streamlit plotly h5py numpy pandas
```

## Step 5: Get a Data File

The app needs an HDF5 (`.h5`) quench data file, which is not included in the repository. 

Example path:

```bash
/Users/yourname/data/quench_data_L1.h5
```

## Step 6: Run the App

From the repository root, run:

```bash
streamlit run interface/app.py
```


## Important:
> - Use `streamlit run` not `python interface/app.py`.

The app opens in your browser automatically. If it doesn't, copy that **URL** from the terminal into your browser.

## Step 7: Use the App

1. Enter the full path to your `.h5` file in the text box at the top.
2. Filter events by **cryomodule, cavity, year** and **label**.
3. Select an event to view its waveform and classification suggestion.
4. Label the event using the buttons at the bottom.

## Troubleshooting: 
| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `streamlit: command not found` | Activate your conda environment with `conda activate YOUR_ENV_NAME` and try running again. If it's still not working, you might not have installed Streamlit, use this command to install it: `conda install streamlit`|
| Nothing happens when you run it | You used `python` instead of `streamlit run` |
| File not found in the app | The HDF5 path you entered is incorrect |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Make sure you are in the `root` directory |
| App won't open in browser | Manually paste the URL from the terminal into your browser.

---
## Stopping the App

In the terminal, press:

```
Ctrl + C
```
